The UN Security Council convened on Wednesday in New York to discuss the deepening crisis, with Assistant Secretary-General for Africa, Martha Bobby, and Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Joyce Msuya, delivering stark warnings. The 17-month war in Sudan has pushed the country to the brink, with no end in sight. Martha Bobby highlighted the deteriorating situation in El Fasher, where civilians remain trapped under siege. Ramtane Lamamra, the UN Secretary-General's envoy for Sudan, continues efforts to mediate between warring parties, engaging with the Sudanese authorities and international mediators in recent months. Joyce Msuya painted a grim picture of the situation in El Fasher. Large-scale fighting, accompanied by heavy artillery and air bombardment, has put civilians, particularly women and children, in grave danger. Msuya outlined three urgent steps needed to prevent further catastrophe. First, she called on the warring parties to comply with international humanitarian law and stop targeting civilians. Second, she urged the international community to prevent atrocities like those witnessed in West Darfur from spreading to El Fasher. Finally, she appealed to donors to increase funding, with less than 50 per cent of the $2.7 billion humanitarian appeal met. She concluded by urging the Security Council to act decisively, stating that the upcoming high-level meetings during the General Assembly represent a crucial opportunity to address the conflict and support the people of Sudan....On 18 September, the Council held an open briefing to discuss the situation in El Fasher. Briefing on the humanitarian situation, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Joyce Msuya reported heavy shelling and aerial bombardment in the city, affecting civilians and civilian infrastructure, including health facilities and camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs). At the same meeting, Assistant Secretary-General for Africa in the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations (DPPA-DPO) Martha Ama Akyaa Pobee noted that “a dangerous new reality has now emerged in the wake of the El Fasher escalation with grave and unpredictable ramifications”. She stressed that the escalation risks widening and entrenching the armed conflict, deepening ethnic polarisation of Sudanese society, and further destabilising the region. During the 18 September Council briefing, however, Russia argued that “it is crucial to involve all influential political forces and the country’s main ethno-confessional groups, including authoritative regional leaders”.",https://allafrica.com/stories/202409230001.html; https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-10/sudan-30.php,MR

He highlighted “shocking reports of mass killings and sexual violence” in villages in east-central Gezira province where paramilitary fighters in a days-long assault had killed more than 120 people in one town. The emergency session follows last month’s UN fact-finding mission that said both sides of the conflict have probably committed war crimes, including targeting civilians and blocking humanitarian aid, during the now 18 months-long civil war....Tomorrow morning (28 October), the Security Council will hold an open briefing, followed by closed consultations, on Sudan. The meeting is being held pursuant to resolution 2715 of 1 December 2023, which requested the Secretary-General to provide a briefing every 120 days on the “UN’s efforts to support Sudan on its path towards peace and stability”. UN Secretary-General António Guterres and a civil society representative are expected to brief in the open chamber. Director of the Operations and Advocacy Division at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Edem Wosornu and Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan Ramtane Lamamra will brief in the consultations.... Guterres is likely to focus on the recommendations outlined in his report under three broad headings: intensifying diplomacy towards ending the fighting, changing the behaviour of the warring parties, and supporting broader protection measures. The report highlights an urgent need for a renewed diplomatic push, including through the “personal involvement” of some heads of state, to ensure that the warring parties uphold their legal obligations. It calls on the warring parties and relevant stakeholders to pursue scalable, locally negotiated ceasefires and other measures to reduce violence, protect civilians, and prevent the spread of conflict..... Lamamra is expected to provide an update on the ongoing regional and international initiatives aimed at resolving the crisis, his engagement with key regional and international interlocutors, and his efforts to coordinate different peace initiatives. With the mediation efforts, not having achieved any breakthrough as yet, members might be interested in hearing Lamamra’s assessment of potential next steps, including strategies for enhancing cooperation among stakeholders and addressing the underlying issues hindering the peace process...... Speaking at the 28 October Council meeting on Sudan, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield (US) supported action from the Council regarding options for the protection of civilians. In this regard, she underlined that “the international community should, in close collaboration with African partners, begin considering options to establish a compliance and monitoring mission, one that could strengthen the protection of civilians and support the implementation and durability of any future local or nationwide cessation of hostilities. At the same meeting, Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia (Russia) stressed that the Council needs to take a balanced approach, taking into account the current developments in the country and the complexity of the historical context in Sudan..... At the 28 October meeting, several Council members welcomed the Secretary-General’s PoC recommendations and voiced support for collective action, while others were more cautious. Algeria, speaking on behalf of the “A3 plus” members (Algeria, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Guyana), said that securing a ceasefire must be the ultimate priority. It added that civilian protection efforts must align with accountability mechanisms to end impunity and bring perpetrators of atrocities and all other types of violations to justice. The US suggested that the international community, in cooperation with African partners, should consider options to establish a “compliance and monitoring mission” that could strengthen PoC and support the implementation and durability of any future local or nationwide cessation of hostilities. On the other hand, Russia stressed that a ceasefire is a decisive factor in ensuring sustained PoC and cautioned that “taking steps to pre-empt this absolutely necessary precondition can result in the opposite of the desired outcome”....At an emergency meeting held at the Security Council, on the heels of reported mass casualty incidents in villages in eastern Sudan, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres voiced alarm over the “utter humanitarian catastrophe” engulfing the country, underscoring the urgent need for “decisive action”, including an immediate cessation of hostilities and unfettered humanitarian access. In that context, he outlined key priorities that diplomatic efforts are aiming to achieve, starting with both sides agreeing to an immediate cessation of hostilities, laying the ground for a comprehensive ceasefire.  His Personal Envoy, Ramtane Lamamra, is working tirelessly to intensify diplomatic efforts to bring the conflict to an end and improve humanitarian access, implementing the commitments in the Jeddah Declaration, he added, pointing to his engagements in Geneva and through regional partners such as the African Union.  He also underscored the need for civilians to be protected, voicing horror at reported attacks by the Rapid Support Forces in El Fasher, as well as attacks and civilian casualties attributed to the Sudanese Armed Forces in Khartoum.

She said Britain, which leads the negotiating and drafting of resolutions on Sudan, would soon circulate a draft resolution to Security Council members. ""The draft resolution will be based on the secretary-general's recommendations and will focus on developing a compliance mechanism for the warring parties' commitments they made on the protection of civilians in Jeddah over a year ago, in 2023, and ways to support mediation efforts to deliver a cease-fire, even if we start with local cease-fires before moving to a national one,"" she said. .....

The people of Sudan face an ever-deepening crisis as the relentless war between rival militaries pushes the country further into chaos, the UN’s top political affairs official told the Security Council on Tuesday, underscoring that a ceasefire and a negotiated political solution remain the only viable path to peace. “Sudan is trapped in a nightmare,” Rosemary DiCarlo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs told ambassadors, echoing the grim declaration made by the Secretary-General two weeks ago. Calling for an immediate ceasefire, Ms. DiCarlo underscored that an end to fighting is the most effective way of protecting civilians. “It is long past time for the warring parties to come to the negotiating table. The only path out of this conflict is a negotiated political solution.” While rival militaries might not be ready for a negotiated settlement, Sudan’s partners have a responsibility to press them to work for one, she said, commending the African Union (AU), the regional development body, IGAD, and the international group supporting humanitarian efforts and peace talks, ALPS – for their attempts to bring the rival generals to the negotiating table. The UN will continue to engage with warring parties through Ramtane Lamamra, the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan, including through regional visits and proximity talks, she added. Ramesh Rajasingham, Director for Coordination at OCHA, told ambassadors that humanitarian organizations “remain unable to reach the vast majority of people in conflict hotspots across Sudan at anything approaching adequate scale.” .... Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on Monday calling for an immediate end to hostilities in Sudan where a war between two rival generals has been raging since April 2023.

Briefing at the meeting, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA) Rosemary DiCarlo strongly condemned the RSF’s attacks on civilians and the SAF’s indiscriminate airstrikes in populated areas. She stressed that both parties bear responsibility for the ongoing violence, highlighting that a cessation of hostilities is the most effective way to protect civilians. DiCarlo pointed to the continued escalation of military operations, the recruitment of new fighters, and intensified attacks by both sides, enabled by “considerable external support,” including a steady influx of weapons into the country. She criticised the role of external actors in fuelling the conflict, describing their involvement as “unconscionable” and “illegal”.DiCarlo said that the Personal Envoy of Secretary-General Ramtane Lamamra is considering the next phase of his engagement with the warring parties, including another round of “proximity talks” focused on commitments related to the protection of civilians. She urged immediate action to implement the Jeddah Declaration, signed by both parties on 11 May 2023 and highlighted the importance of a compliance mechanism to hold the parties accountable to their commitments. She underlined the need to make progress on achieving local ceasefires that could create avenues for dialogue and potentially lay the ground for a more comprehensive agreement......

Sudan is expected to participate under rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure. Tomorrow, the briefers and several Council members are expected to condemn the ongoing violence across Sudan and reiterate the call for an immediate cessation of hostilities. They might highlight the imperative to ensure accountability and justice for victims of violence and call on the parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law.

The meeting, facilitated by the German special envoy for peace, was part of ongoing efforts to address the deadlock in peace talks, which had stalled since May 2017. Dr. Jibril Ibrahim, head of the JEM, emphasized that this meeting was crucial for progressing the peace process.

The German government, in its efforts to revive the peace negotiations, had previously invited the parties for informal consultations. These talks had failed to yield results due to disagreements over the 2011 Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, which the Sudanese government insisted upon as the basis for negotiations, while the rebel movements rejected it.

South Sudan's President to Mediate Peace Talks for Sudan's Restive Regions

Sudan has for the first time agreed to South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir mediating peace talks concerning its troubled border regions of South Kordofan and Blue Nile. This marks a significant shift, as Sudan had previously accused its southern neighbor of exacerbating unrest in these areas, where rebels have continued to resist Khartoum's rule even after South Sudan’s independence in 2011.

Ibrahim al-Sadiq, a spokesperson for Sudan’s ruling party, confirmed that President Kiir has initiated discussions with factions from the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) active in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. These talks aim to achieve a peace settlement and address long-standing conflicts in these regions...... November 5, 2018 (JUBA) – South Sudanese government will host peace talks between the Sudanese government and all the armed groups in Sudan including Darfur movement, announced the presidency in Juba.
Last week, Juba announced a mediation to reunite the two factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and narrow the gaps between them and Khartoum in an effort to facilitate a peaceful settlement for the conflict in the Two Areas which border South Sudan.

But on Monday Presidential Adviser Tut Kew Gatluak announced that all the armed opposition groups in Darfur are also invited to Juba for discussions with the Sudanese government in a bid to reach a comprehensive peace agreement in Sudan.

South Sudan’s involvement in these negotiations comes amid ongoing efforts by Sudan's government, which has unilaterally declared ceasefires in South Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur since 2015. Although fighting has decreased, a comprehensive peace agreement remains elusive.

Additionally, South Sudan’s President Kiir has been formally appointed to mediate between Khartoum and the armed opposition groups in these conflict zones. Tut Kew, Kiir’s security advisor, announced that the president had agreed to facilitate dialogue between the Khartoum government and Sudanese rebels, emphasizing South Sudan's commitment to fostering peace and stability in the region.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/Article/agency-wire/242288-sudan-accepts-south-sudanese-mediation-in-border-regions;https://www.dawn.com/news/1443665/khartoum-accepts-south-sudans-mediation;https://thedefensepost.com/2018/11/05/south-sudan-kiir-mediate-sudan-peace-talks/;http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2018-11/06/content_70430866.htm;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-11/06/c_137584413.htm;http://www.africanews.com/2018/11/06/salva-kiir-to-mediate-peace-talks-between-sudan-gov-t-rebels/; http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article64695,M

The mediation efforts were seen as a pivotal moment in Sudan's transition, with both sides expressing cautious optimism about the future of the negotiations.

General Shamseddine Kabbashi, spokesman for the ruling military council, indicated that while there are some observations regarding the proposal, it serves as a viable foundation for resuming negotiations to form an interim authority.

The proposal, received on June 27, marks a significant step in the stalled negotiations between the military and the opposition coalition. Following the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir on April 11, the military and opposition have struggled to agree on the structure of a transitional government. The AU and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have been working to facilitate a return to direct talks between the two sides....

Would be great for 30 June to be a day of celebration, rather than new protests.""...Protesters and opposition groups that are demanding the military hand over power to civilian rule said Thursday it received a new proposal for a transition drafted by Ethiopia and the African Union.

The new proposal calls for a civilian-majority ruling council as demanded by protesters, but it fails to mention the make-up of a new transitional parliament.

“The Alliance for Freedom and Change received the draft… and will be considering the proposal to make a decision,” the umbrella group said in a statement.

The move comes after Sudan’s ruling generals urged mediators from the AU and Ethiopia to unify their efforts and come up with a joint proposal on the country’s transition.

It entails creating a 15-member, civilian-majority governing body for a three-year transitional period.

But it makes no mention of the composition of a legislative body.

An earlier proposal drafted by Ethiopia had stipulated a transitional parliament of 300 lawmakers, with 67 percent of them from the Alliance for Freedom and Change.

The remaining 33 percent were to be from other political groups, excluding now ousted longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir defunct National Congress Party....Kabbashi had earlier said the Transitional Military Council, TMC, had not even looked at the Ethiopian plan because it was from only one stakeholder.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was in Khartoum earlier this month after special forces forcibly broke up a sit-in killing hundreds and injuring many more.

The junta and protest leaders had cut all contact despite Abiy’s envoy managing to secure an agreement for resumption. The protesters have since called for a mediator saying they had lost trust in the TMC.

An earlier proposal by Abiy Ahmed had been accepted by the protesters but rejected by the military. The new joint proposal from the AU and Ethiopia now aims to provide a basis for renewed negotiations, with the goal of establishing a civilian-led transitional administration in Sudan.",https://www.france24.com/en/20190629-sudan-generals-say-au-ethiopian-plan-basis-talks-with-protesters;http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/sudan-generals-say-au-ethiopian-plan-basis-for-talks-with-protesters/article/553015;https://www.africanews.com/2019/06/29/sudan-s-army-accepts-au-ethiopia-transition-proposal-as-protestors-plan/;https://allafrica.com/stories/201906300044.html; https://www.africanews.com/2019/05/20/sudan-s-president-bashir-steps-down-govt-sources/,M

",,"After months of intense negotiations, Sudan's military and the alliance of protesters and opposition groups have signed a significant power-sharing agreement. The initial document, known as the ""Political Declaration,"" was agreed upon after a night of detailed discussions. Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, deputy chief of the ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC), and Ibrahim al-Amin from the protest movement, both marked the occasion as a ""historic moment"" for Sudan.

The agreement, brokered by the African Union and Ethiopian mediators, establishes a new transitional civilian-military ruling body designed to navigate Sudan through its political crisis. The deal stipulates a governing body with six civilians and five military representatives, aiming to address the country's prolonged instability following the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir in April. The six civilian members will include five from the Alliance for Freedom and Change.

Ethiopian mediator Mahmud Dirir emphasized the need for Sudan to overcome poverty and called for the removal of Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. The formal signing ceremony, which was attended by international observers including representatives from the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and the Arab League, marks a crucial step toward a political transition.

While the Political Declaration is a landmark achievement, both sides will continue negotiations on the ""Constitutional Declaration,"" expected to be signed soon. This ongoing dialogue is essential for finalizing the framework for Sudan’s transition to a new government....""July 17: Sudan military, protesters reach deal
Sudan’s military and the alliance of protesters and opposition groups signed a political accord on Wednesday as part of a power-sharing deal aimed at leading the country nation to democracy.

The agreement was signed in Khartoum in the presence of African mediators following a night of talks to iron out some details of the agreement reached earlier this month.

The deal is meant to pave the way to a political transition in Sudan after military leaders ousted former President Omar al-Bashir in April following weeks of protests against him.

“We want a stable homeland, because we have suffered a great deal,” Ibrahim al-Amin, a leader in the opposition Forces for Freedom and Change coalition, said after the ceremony.

The landmark power sharing deal, which was agreed on July 5, has been brokered by African Union and Ethiopian mediators after intense negotiations between the protest umbrella group and ruling generals.

Ethiopian mediator Mahmud Dirir said Sudan needed to overcome poverty and called for the country to be taken of a U.S. list of states that support terrorism....The Transitional Military Council and the Declaration of Freedom and Change forces agree to set up transitional institutions: the Sovereignty Council, Council of Ministers, Legislative Council, and the Investigation Committee. They also set out a list of agreed aims for these institutions. Finally, they invite international actors (states and organisations) to support the implementation of the agreement - but there is no agreement or commitment on provision of said aid.

The sides are still working on a constitutional declaration, which is expected to be signed on Friday""",https://www.pulse.com.gh/news/world/sudan-protesters-army-rulers-ink-power-sharing-deal-afp/f0f9kb2;http://www.africanews.com/2019/07/17/sudan-s-president-bashir-steps-down-govt-sources/;http://awate.com/dr-abiy-african-union-succeed-sudan/;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/sudan-s-power-sharing-deal-an-exercise-in-optimism; https://www.africanews.com/2019/04/13/sudan-s-president-bashir-steps-down-govt-sources/; https://www.peaceagreements.org/view/2243; https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/this-week-s-news-in-brief-172;http://www.arabnews.com/node/1520146/middle-east;http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/sudan-protesters-agree-to-direct-talks-with-ruling-generals/article/553295; http://www.arabnews.com/node/1519541/middle-east; http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2019-07/03/content_74946261.htm; https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/7/3/sudan-protesters-military-resume-talks-over-civilian-rule;https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/sudan-protesters-generals-resume-talks-over-civilian-rule/448185;https://www.yenisafak.com/en/news/sudanese-protesters-resume-talks-with-army-after-deadlock-3484804;https://www.france24.com/en/20190704-sudan-talks-enter-day-two-key-issue-still-unresolved; https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/07/05/Military-civilians-to-share-power-in-Sudan-until-elections-in-2022/2531562321631/;http://www.marxist.com/sudan-no-to-a-rotten-compromise.htm;https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/w/deadlock-broken-sudan-parties-agree-transitional-government; https://www.africanews.com/2019/07/12/au-claims-breakthrough-in-sudan-; https://www.wkms.org/post/sudanese-leaders-reach-power-sharing-agreement;https://countervortex.org/node/16395talks/;https://menafn.com/1098753251/AU-claims-breakthrough-in-Sudan-talks;http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201907/14/WS5d2a233ea3105895c2e7d4b9.html;https://24tanzania.com/uganda-ready-to-help-in-darfur-conflict/; https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/coordination-mechanism-on-unamid-situation-in-darfur-improved-significantly;https://www.africa-newsroom.com/press/note-to-correspondents-on-joint-united-nationsafrican-union-visit-to-sudan-central-african-republic-and-ethiopia;https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/coordination-mechanism-unamid-situation-darfur-improved-significantly; https://www.africanews.com/2019/05/16/sudan-s-president-bashir-steps-down-govt-sources/; http://www.arabnews.com/node/1525121; https://www.apnews.com/26b4be7bb363488891b420da9ebe4871; https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/sudan-presentation-of-draft-document-of-agreement-expected-today; http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-07/14/c_138224414.htm,M

Thousands of Sudanese demonstrators rallied in the capital and other cities Thursday after protest leaders called for a “million-strong” march to condemn the killings of four schoolchildren.

Some protesters, like Hadi Emad, are skeptical that the killing of protesters by security forces will ever stop.

He says the crimes are repeated, and not stopped, because of a lack of transparency and the absence of punishment. He says if we consider the TMC's admission to be a step towards accountability, we demand transparent trials and the punishment of the killers.

",,"August 17, 2019 ( KHARTOUM) – Sudan will celebrate Saturday the signing of the Political Agreement and the Constitutional Declaration on the Transitional Authority that will lead the country for three years and three months before the first democratic general elections after the fall of the al-Bashir regime.
The celebration which will be attended by regional leaders and ministerial delegations will take place at the Friendship Hall in  Khartoum at 01:00 PM. Also, a popular celebration and parties will be held in the Freedom Park which is nearby the Hall.

The residents of Atbara where were killed the first protesters in December 2018 will participate in the celebrations, as a train full of people arrived in  Khartoum on Friday. Also, arrived in Khartoum, Moussa Faki Mahamat, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Ugandan Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa, Djibouti Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Yusuf....""Sudan's military rulers and opposition leaders have signed a landmark power-sharing agreement, marking a significant step toward establishing civilian rule and transitioning from decades of autocratic governance under Omar al-Bashir. The deal, which finalizes the constitutional declaration initially inked on August 4, aims to pave the way for a transitional government and eventual elections.

The agreement was reached after nearly eight months of intense upheaval and protests against Bashir, who was ousted in April after 30 years in power. The deal was brokered with strong mediation from the African Union and Ethiopia. The signing ceremony, held in Khartoum, was attended by international representatives, including the presidents of Chad, Kenya, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan, as well as the prime ministers of Egypt and Ethiopia, and other prominent figures such as Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The deal has been welcomed by both the military council and the opposition coalition, the Alliance for Freedom and Change. The agreement was seen as a crucial step in restoring stability to Sudan, which has been grappling with an economic crisis and a volatile regional context. The compromise, while addressing several key demands of the protest camp, allows the military to retain significant powers, posing ongoing challenges for the future civilian government.

In a notable development, Sudan’s Sovereign Council was sworn in on August 21, with Abdalla Hamdok appointed as Prime Minister. This event marked a significant milestone in Sudan’s transition to democracy. The swearing-in was celebrated by many Sudanese in Khartoum, reflecting their hopes for the future.

The signing of the agreement received broad international support, with the European Union and other global partners witnessing the ceremony. The UN Security Council, the EU, and the Troika (the US, UK, and Norway) all expressed support for the agreement. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also extended congratulations and support to the transitional authorities.

The formation of the Sovereign Council and the appointment of the Prime Minister are seen as critical steps in Sudan’s journey toward peace, democracy, and prosperity. The road ahead remains challenging, but the international and regional backing provides a foundation for hopeful progress in Sudan’s transition.""

While four regional leaders of South Sudan, Chad, Kenya and the Ethiopian Prime Minister will attend the ceremony, the Egyptian President who is the head of the African Union declined the invitation as will be represented by his Prime Minister Mostafa Kemal Madbouly.

Expected to arrive in  Khartoum, Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Hamad Al Sabah-First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait, Adel Al-Jubeir Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa Bahrain’s Foreign Minister and Yousef Al-Othaimeen the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

His visit comes as Sudan undergoes a pivotal transition from decades of autocratic rule under former President Omar al-Bashir.

Maas's arrival follows the recent swearing-in of a new prime minister and a civilian-majority ruling body, which will oversee Sudan through a three-year transitional period. This transition is part of a power-sharing deal signed on August 17, which followed months of protests led by an umbrella group against Bashir's regime and the subsequent military takeover.

During his visit, Maas is set to meet with Sudan's newly appointed Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and the head of Sudan’s Sovereign Council, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. In a statement before his arrival, Maas described Sudan as standing ""at a turning point of its history.""

The German Foreign Minister’s trip underscores Berlin’s commitment to supporting Sudan as it navigates its transition and works to address significant challenges, including economic revitalization and peace negotiations with armed groups. Maas also plans to discuss ways to integrate Sudan back into the international community and help the country overcome its longstanding international isolation.

The visit highlights Germany’s broader efforts to aid Sudan’s recovery and development, following the recent formal steps taken by the international community to potentially lift Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terror, which had been imposed in 1993 and remained through the al-Bashir era.

The talks, which were mediated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and World Bank President David Malpass, aimed to address the concerns of all parties involved.

The key issue at stake is the potential impact of the dam on Egypt’s share of Nile waters, which are crucial for the country’s water supply....Egypt has confirmed that it, along with Ethiopia and Sudan, has been invited by the United States to a meeting on November 6 in Washington to address the ongoing dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). This meeting aims to resolve the deadlock that has persisted over the massive hydroelectric project on the Nile River.

Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry announced the date of the meeting during a press conference with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. Shoukry emphasized that Egypt views the mediation effort as a sign of goodwill and reiterated the country's commitment to resolving the issues through diplomatic and peaceful means.

Egypt has voiced fears that the dam could significantly disrupt its water resources, which account for 90 percent of its drinking water. Conversely, Ethiopia views the dam as a critical hydropower project that stands to benefit its economic development. Sudan, while benefiting from the dam's hydropower, has aligned more closely with Ethiopia’s position.

The January 15 deadline marks a crucial point in the negotiations, which have faced setbacks and deadlocks. The foreign ministers agreed to hold four additional technical meetings to further discuss and potentially resolve the issues surrounding the dam's construction and operation.

The Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement, signed the Sudanese government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) rebel alliance in Juba on Friday, allocates 30 per cent of all positions at the legislative and executive level in the eastern states to the Beja Congress (a political association of Beja and other tribes) and the Popular Front (a coalition of eastern Sudanese rebel groups). It also guarantees 14 per cent of all public positions in state institutions for local people. Imbalances in the civil service will be addressed.

He was speaking to the leaders of the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) present in Juba, where the Sudanese peace negotiations take place, on Saturday. El Burhan stated that “the masses have an absence of awareness”. “Providing them with misleading information that leads to demonstrations created a polarised political environment, which caused many not to believe in the military,” he said. He reaffirmed that the military is not interested in governing the country, but wants to work with the transitional government to reach a national compromise.

He said both the SPLM-N and the Sudan Revolutionary Front rebel alliance are ready to resolve all outstanding issues and reach a final peace agreement.

Arman said the split of the SPLM-N into two factions headed by Malik Agar and Abdelaziz El Hilu and the lack of coordination on negotiating positions between the two rebel groups, is detrimental to the Two Areas (South Kordofan and Blue Nile). This will harm the whole of Sudan, he stated.

The Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) decided to send a large delegation to Juba. It will be divided into two. One delegation is to join the daily negotiations. The other delegation will facilitate the negotiation process and meet both the SPLM-N led by Abdelaziz El Hilu and the SRF to discuss all outstanding issues.

FFC spokesman Wajdi Saleh stated that the Sudanese government negotiation delegation now includes representatives of the cabinet, the Sovereign Council and the FFC.

The signing ceremony, attended by a wide array of local, regional, and international dignitaries, included Sudan's Sovereign Council Chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and South Sudanese President Salva Kiir. Notable attendees also included representatives from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Chad, Egypt, the African Union, the United Nations, and the European Union.

Qatar played a pivotal role as one of the key sponsors of the negotiations, with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad Al Muraikhi describing the event as a “unique moment in history” that represents the hopes of millions displaced by war. The agreement covers various aspects, including security arrangements, power and wealth sharing, compensation for displaced individuals, land ownership, and justice and development.

This agreement comprises a series of in-essence 6 different agreements which provide for agreement between the Transitional Government of Sudan (TGOS)and different areas, on different but interconnected peace process 'tracks'. These comprise a Darfur Agreement between the TGOS and 'Darfur Parties to Peace' (Title 2); a 'Two Areas' agreements between TGOS and the The Sudan People's Liberation Movement - North / The Revolutionary Front (Title 3); the Eastern Sudan Track Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 4); Track 5, Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front - Northern Track (Title 5); Agreement of the Central Track between the TSGO and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 6); and Security arrangements between the TSGO and the Third-Front - Tamazuj (Title 7). While the agreements are all varied, they provide on the most part for some representation of these areas in the transitional government and/or wider institutional structures of the transition, and for new governance and security and economic / development provision within each area. The Agreement therefore in its totality in a sense connects the wider armed conflict with different groups, or different factions or branches of the same broad group, with the transition process focused on the move from military rule at the level of the central state, and with the Transitional government (itself a mixed military-civilian government).

This development comes after a high-level Israeli delegation, including officials from the Mossad intelligence agency, arrived in Khartoum on a private jet to finalize the deal. The announcement of diplomatic ties is anticipated to be made soon, as reported by the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom.

This move aligns with recent shifts in Middle Eastern diplomacy and represents a significant step for Sudan in deepening its engagement with the West. U.S. President Donald Trump has also played a crucial role in this process, recently removing Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. This action has facilitated Sudan's path to normalization with Israel and has unblocked potential economic aid and investment.

The normalization agreement is part of a broader trend, as U.S. and Israeli officials have noted interest from additional Arab states in pursuing peace deals with Israel. The recent Congressional resolutions in the U.S. further support the Abraham Accords and encourage other Arab nations to establish full relations with Israel, aiming for comprehensive peace in the region.... ""An official Israeli delegation will visit Sudan on Sunday to promote the process of normalizing relations between the two countries, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation said.

The visit will be the first since US President Donald Trump announced last month that Sudan would start normalizing ties with Israel with the two set to sign deals covering agriculture, trade, aviation and migration.

An Israeli source said the delegation will include experts and officials from the National Security Council and the Foreign Ministry.""

In the context of Sudan, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and the transitional government, following the ousting of Omar al-Bashir in 2019, have signaled their willingness to recognize Israel.

The week-long negotiations, held via videoconference, include water ministers from the three countries, as well as representatives from the African Union, European Union and the World Bank.

Previous three-way talks have failed to produce an agreement on the filling and operation of the vast reservoir behind the 145-meter (475-foot) tall hydropower Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).... ""Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia have once again failed to reach an agreement on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) following a week of negotiations under the auspices of the African Union (AU). The ministers of Water Resources from the three countries convened virtually to discuss the framework for managing the ongoing negotiations but could not reconcile their differences on the negotiation methodology and the role of African Union experts.

Sudan’s Irrigation and Water Resources Minister, Yasir Abbas, confirmed that the discussions ended without tangible progress, leading the parties to agree to return the issue to the AU. The three countries decided that each would submit a report to South Africa, the current chair of the AU, detailing their meeting outcomes.

The failure to advance the talks has been attributed to disagreements over the methodology for concluding the negotiations and the role of experts. This round of discussions, which concluded on November 4, follows earlier meetings where similar issues had been unresolved. Sudan's High Committee for the Follow-Up on the GERD, led by Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, emphasized the need to secure an agreement to ensure the safe operation of the Roseires Dam in Blue Nile state, which is in proximity to the Ethiopian dam.

The disengagement was decided in response to Sudan's inclusion on the agenda of the extraordinary meeting without prior consultation with the Sudanese government, and the IGAD's invitation to a militia leader to attend the Kampala summit. Sudanese officials are upset that a rebel leader was invited to a meeting for heads of state and government. On January 13, the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the head of the Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan would not attend the 42nd summit due to the failure of the IGAD to secure a meeting between him and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)....The Intergovernmental Authority on Development's (IGAD) efforts to end the conflict between Sudan military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his paramilitary rival General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo is hanging in the balance. IGAD was caught off guard by Sudan's decision to cut ties with the regional body which was accused of siding with the paramilitary wing. According to reports by international media outlets, Sudan leader General al-Burhan, on Tuesday, accused IGAD of inviting General Dagalo to the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement Summit to be conducted by its members - Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and Sudan. Al-Burhan's administration claimed that his nemesis was invited without its knowledge which it claimed risked the peace and well-being of the warring nation. Sudan's Foreign Ministry which raised the concern, however, did not indicate whether it was willing to hold talks with IGAD which was accused of bias. The meeting came against the backdrop of IGAD ending Ruto's mission to mediate between the waring parties in Sudan owing to al-Burhan's protests. al-Burhan had also accused Ruto of siding with his paramilitary rival General Dagalo....""The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-country trade bloc in East Africa, kicked off its Assembly of Heads of State and Government on Thursday in Uganda.

Leaders of the organization, made up of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda, called for the 42nd Extraordinary Session to contain a wave of tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia and breathe new life into face-to-face meetings between the heads of Sudan's warring factions, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Both Sudan and Ethiopia declined to attend.""... January 18, 2024 (KAMPALA) – Commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo met with the heads of state of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) on the sidelines of the 42nd Extraordinary Meeting in Kampala on Thursday to discuss his vision for ending the ongoing conflict in Sudan.

Dagalo’s attendance at the IGAD summit was initially in doubt after Sovereign Council Chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced his boycott of the meeting. However, IGAD leaders decided to meet with Dagalo separately to hear his perspective on the conflict....Friday, January 19, 2024 - President William Ruto and other Heads of State who attended the 42nd Extraordinary Assembly of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), unveiled strategies to bring an end to the ongoing conflict in Sudan.

The workshop, organized by the French organization Premediation in collaboration with the French and Egyptian Ministries of Foreign Affairs, was initially scheduled to include representatives from the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Sources close to the workshop revealed that the Sudanese army had reservations about attending, while the RSF initially expressed their approval. However, as of late Monday evening, there was no confirmation of their representatives’ arrival in Cairo.

The RSF, a paramilitary group that controls four out of five states in Darfur, has been engaged in fierce clashes with the Sudanese army since October 2023.

The workshop will focus on two key topics: 1) achieving a ceasefire in Darfur and 2) establishing a joint committee between the military authorities in the region to reduce tensions and promote coordination.Among the armed movements attending the workshop are the Secretary of Presidential Affairs of the Gathering of Sudan Liberation Forces, Brigadier General Mubarak Bakhit, and the Vice President of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) led by Suleiman Sandal, Gibril Adam Bilal. Additionally, Seif al-Din Issa, Advisor to the President of the Sudan Liberation Movement Transitional Council (SLM-TC, is also participating.

However, the participation of the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Minni Arko Minawi remains uncertain. While the Justice and Equality Movement led by Gibril Ibrahim decided to boycott the meeting. Hassan Ibrahim Fadl, JEM Spokesman acknowledged their invitation to the workshop but expressed their regret for not attending. In a statement on Monday night, he explained that the JEM decided to withdraw after learning that the RSF was invited to participate in the meeting.

The groups said that the RSF should implement the Jeddah Declaration to Cessation of Hostilities, signed on May 11, 2023, which stipulates the withdrawal of the paramilitary group from civilian areas",https://sudantribune.com/article281586/,M
