This agreement took place during a tripartite meeting on Sunday in Cairo at the invitation of the Secretary General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, in an effort to bring views closer and end the political impasse through a Libyan-Libyan dialogue. The statement of the heads of the three councils stressed the necessity of forming a unified government responsible for supervising the electoral process and providing the necessary services to Libyans. They also agreed to hold a second round urgently to complete this agreement and bring it into effect, while calling on the United Nations Support Mission in Libya and the international community to support its outcomes. The statement indicated that the meeting parties agreed to unify sovereign positions to ensure the activation of their role at the level of the Libyan state. It stressed Libya's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and rejected any negative external interference in the political process. The host country, Egypt, considered the outcomes of the meeting an important step on the path to achieving the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people. In a statement issued by the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the meeting, Egypt welcomed the Arab League’s hosting of the meeting between Menfi, Takala and Saleh, explaining that this meeting comes “within the framework of supporting the exclusive Libyan ownership of the political settlement, and strengthening the role of Libyan institutions in fulfilling all necessary frameworks for holding presidential and parliamentary elections.....

The leaders who reached the deal were Presidential Council president Mohamed Menfi and High State Council head Mohamed Takala, who are both based in Tripoli, and Aguila Saleh, speaker of the House of Representatives in Benghazi. The talks in the Egyptian capital Cairo were brokered by the Arab League and led by its secretary-general Ahmed Aboul Gheit. Mr Menfi told the media after the meeting: “The measures that were agreed upon today are a very important beginning. “They are results that live up to the ambition of Libyans to hold elections.” .... The leaders are the president of the Presidential Council (PC) Mohamed Menfi, the head of High State Council (HSC) Mohamed Takala, who are both based in Tripoli, and Aguila Saleh, speaker of the House of Representatives (HoR) in Benghazi. In a joint statement, the three leaders also called on the UN Mission in Libya and the international community to support their proposals.
